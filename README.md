A C++11 (and later) fixed point API that can be compiled with -0fast to allow the fastest program.

See FP_S_examples.cpp for quick examples.

See FP_S_global_functioning.cpp for many more details and examples.

Call Fixed_Point_Static.hpp in your program to use it.
See also Fixed_Point_Static_operators.hpp for more available operators.
